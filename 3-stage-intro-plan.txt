üéØ SWITCH-PHONE 3-STAGE INTRO EXPERIENCE PLAN
==================================================

üìã OVERVIEW:
Build an immersive 3-stage intro experience for Switch-Phone website using React/Next.js with Three.js.
Keep /3d-demo untouched as development playground.

üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE:
- / (root) ‚Üí Video ‚Üí 3D Model ‚Üí Enter Website Button
- /3d-demo ‚Üí Current demo (UNTOUCHED)
- /website ‚Üí Actual website content (redirect current pages here)

---

üß± STAGE 1: INTRO VIDEO SCREEN
==============================

DESKTOP VERSION:
1. Show fullscreen autoplay video as soon as website loads
2. Use HTML5 <video> element:
   - Autoplay
   - Mute by default
   - No controls
   - Fullscreen with black background
3. Video file location: /public/intro.mp4
4. Optional "Skip Intro" button in corner
5. When video ends ‚Üí fade to Stage 2

MOBILE VERSION (Autoplay Restrictions):
- Show "Tap to Experience" overlay with:
  - Switch-Phone hero image/animation
  - Compelling call-to-action
  - Maybe short GIF preview loop
- When tapped ‚Üí plays video with sound
- Progressive disclosure approach

TECHNICAL:
- Use localStorage to show video only once per session:
  localStorage.setItem("introSeen", "true")
- Detect autoplay capability and adapt accordingly
- Mobile detection and fallback strategy

---

üß± STAGE 2: 3D MODEL SHOWCASE
=============================

DESIGN:
- Complete blank screen (no navigation, no clutter)
- 3D Switch-Phone model (separate from /3d-demo)
- Interactive (rotate, zoom)
- Single button: "Enter Website" or "Go to Website"

EXPERIENCE:
- Fade in from video
- Users can explore the 3D model
- Focus 100% on Switch-Phone
- Professional, premium feel

TECHNICAL:
- Create new 3D component (don't touch existing SwitchPhone3D.tsx)
- Blank background
- Optimized for performance
- Smooth transitions

---

üß± STAGE 3: WEBSITE ENTRY
=========================

TRANSITION:
- Single prominent button
- Clear call-to-action
- Redirect to /website (or restructured main site)

PSYCHOLOGY:
- By this point, user is invested
- "Enter Website" feels like deliberate choice
- Creates anticipation for full experience

---

üìÅ FILE STRUCTURE PLAN:
=======================

CURRENT (Keep Untouched):
- /src/app/3d-demo/page.tsx ‚Üí Development playground
- /src/components/SwitchPhone3D.tsx ‚Üí Demo component

NEW FILES TO CREATE:
- /src/app/page.tsx ‚Üí 3-stage experience controller
- /src/components/IntroVideo.tsx ‚Üí Stage 1 component
- /src/components/Intro3DModel.tsx ‚Üí Stage 2 component (new, separate)
- /src/app/website/page.tsx ‚Üí Move current content here
- /public/intro.mp4 ‚Üí Intro video file

ROUTE CHANGES:
- / ‚Üí 3-stage experience
- /3d-demo ‚Üí Keep as-is (untouched)
- /website ‚Üí Main website content
- Other pages ‚Üí Move under /website/ structure

---

üé® USER EXPERIENCE FLOW:
========================

1. USER LANDS ON /
   ‚Üì
2. VIDEO PLAYS (or tap-to-play on mobile)
   ‚Üì
3. FADES TO 3D MODEL on blank screen
   ‚Üì
4. USER INTERACTS with 3D model
   ‚Üì
5. CLICKS "Enter Website"
   ‚Üì
6. REDIRECTS TO /website (full site)

PSYCHOLOGICAL JOURNEY:
- Hook (video)
- Wow (3D interaction)
- Convert (website entry)

---

üîß TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
============================

PERFORMANCE:
- Lazy load 3D components
- Optimize video compression
- Smooth transitions between stages
- Mobile-responsive design

ACCESSIBILITY:
- Video captions available
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Skip options for users who need them

BROWSER SUPPORT:
- Autoplay detection

- Graceful fallbacks
- Cross-browser testing

---

üí° IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES:
=============================

PHASE 1: Basic Structure
- Set up route structure
- Create component shells
- Basic video implementation

PHASE 2: 3D Integration
- Create separate 3D component
- Implement transitions
- Add Enter Website button

PHASE 3: Polish & Mobile
- Mobile autoplay handling
- Smooth animations
- Performance optimization
- Testing across devices

PHASE 4: Enhancement
- localStorage handling
- Analytics integration
- A/B testing setup
- Final polish

---

üéØ SUCCESS METRICS:
==================

USER ENGAGEMENT:
- Video completion rate
- 3D interaction time
- Website entry conversion
- Bounce rate improvement

TECHNICAL:
- Load time performance
- Mobile compatibility
- Cross-browser functionality
- Accessibility compliance

---

üìù NOTES:
=========

- Keep /3d-demo completely untouched for development
- This creates a premium, Apple-like product reveal experience
- Progressive disclosure builds user investment
- Clean separation allows for easy iteration and testing
- Mobile-first approach ensures broad compatibility
